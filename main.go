// conf-hub — the initial HTTP service of the conf organization.
//
// It was born from aegis's `base` template and from that moment on it
// is YOURS: the template never touches it again. Zero external
// dependencies on purpose (Go's stdlib is enough to serve HTTP): an
// empty dependency tree is a tree that does not rot.
//
// The only thing the platform asks of this process is that it listen
// on the port the contract declares (8080) and answer /healthz — the
// Deployment's readinessProbe queries it. The rest is your app.
